# Operation People’s Veto: Auth Bypass Challenge

Welcome, Autoveto Sentinel!

The coup plotters have learned from their mistakes. Their defenses are stronger, but in their rush, they’ve tangled their own authentication logic! Somewhere in the Ministry’s digital fortress, a logic flaw is waiting to be exploited. Can you break through and keep ESIPE free?

## Mission Brief

The threat actors have upgraded their security, but their logic is flawed. Your mission:

1. **Launch the lab:**
	```sh
	chmod +x run_lab.sh
	./run_lab.sh
	```
2. **Analyze the authentication flow.**
3. **Find and exploit the logic bug to bypass authentication!**
4. **Capture the flag and help roll back the coup!**
